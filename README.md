# DSCI-591 - Podcast Recommender System

Building a Hybrid podcast recommender system by merging content-based podcast recommender system and collaborative podcast recommender  system

## Overview

The purpose of building a podcast recommender system is to enhance the podcast listening experience for users by providing personalized recommendations tailored to their interests and preferences. Users now find it more and more challenging to find new podcasts they might appreciate due to the expansion of podcasting over the past several years. The majority of podcast listeners have a small number of favorites, and they are typically cautious to try something new. Users can't listen to the first ten seconds of a podcast or skim through a preview as they do with music or movies to decide whether they enjoy it. The issue of connecting consumers to podcasts they would appreciate is made more difficult by the length and topic diversity of podcasts. Additionally, people find it very hard to go through all of the podcasts and episodes to discover the one they enjoy owing to the overwhelming number of podcasts available.

## Data

It often becomes necessary to combine several datasets when developing a recommendation system for podcasts. For our approach, One dataset contains detailed descriptions of podcasts, which can be used to build a content-based recommendation system. And, Another dataset contains reviews and ratings of the podcasts, which can be used to build a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system.

Here's an expanded explanation of how this integration can enhance the recommendation process:

+ Content-based recommendation system: The dataset containing detailed descriptions of podcasts is valuable for building a content-based recommendation system. This approach analyzes the textual information associated with each podcast, such as the title, description, episode summaries, and potentially even transcripts. By employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system can extract relevant keywords, topics, and other metadata to understand the content of each podcast. This information forms the basis for recommending similar podcasts to users.

+ Collaborative filtering-based recommendation system: The dataset with reviews and ratings provides an opportunity to build a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system. Collaborative filtering considers the behavior and preferences of a user along with the collective behavior of a larger user community. By analyzing the reviews and ratings, the system can identify patterns and similarities between users' tastes. This enables the system to recommend podcasts that align with a user's interests based on the preferences of similar users.
